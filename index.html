            Please feel at home with us. We were 
            founded on Wednesday 8th January 2025 
            with one simple concept in mind - to 
            provide a hearty meal, sit down 
            together and eat and mutually support 
            each other with any successes, failures 
            and issues.
         </p>
         <p class="homepage__activatesText">
            All our other activates have spun off 
            from our meals together. For example, 
            Forces of Nature gardening project. 
         </p>
         <p class="homepage__endText">
            Come: relax, enjoy good food, good 
            company, vibes, good support and leave
            your rank behind when you sit down and 
            eat with us!

                We believe this of ourselves: We,
                each one of us, have made a unique 
                decision at least once in our lives
                to serve humanity in a very special 
                way. Therefore, we fully understand
                each other's needs. We are therefore, 
                indebted to our Principle Sponsor and 
                to all our friends for strengthening 
                our ability to support each other in 
                profound, deeply meaningful and 
                practical ways.

            <p class="ethos__sponsorText">
                The Parish of St Dunstan and All 
                Saints', Stepney have opened their 
                hearts and their doors to us. They 
                provide the budget for us to buy the 
                ingredients and then venue for free.
                </br>
                We are not a 'churchy' group. You will 
                find a warm, discrete welcome from the 
                church and leadership. What you won't 
                find is 'Bible Bashing', proselytizing 
                and judgement.
                </br>
                However, if you wish to tap into the 
                church with a one to one chat with the 
                rector or chaplain - that's on offer. 
                If you wish to sit quietly in a corner 
                of the church to pray - that's on offer. 
                If you wish to talk about life events 
                like baptism, confirmation or marriage - 
                that's on offer. If you want to come to 
                Mass - that's on offer. f you want to talk 
                privately about spiritual matters - that's 
                on offer. If you want to be left alone just 
                to enjoy your lunch - that's on offer too!
