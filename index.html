            Please feel at home with us. We were 
            founded on Wednesday 8th January 2025 
            with one simple concept in mind - to 
            provide a hearty meal, sit down 
            together and eat and mutually support 
            each other with any successes, failures 
            and issues.
         </p>
         <p class="homepage__activatesText">
            All our other activates have spun off 
            from our meals together. For example, 
            Forces of Nature gardening project. 
         </p>
         <p class="homepage__endText">
            Come: relax, enjoy good food, good 
            company, vibes, good support and leave
            your rank behind when you sit down and 
            eat with us!
