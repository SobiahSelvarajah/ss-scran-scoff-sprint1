            Please feel at home with us. We were 
            founded on Wednesday 8th January 2025 
            with one simple concept in mind - to 
            provide a hearty meal, sit down 
            together and eat and mutually support 
            each other with any successes, failures 
            and issues.
         </p>
         <p class="homepage__activatesText">
            All our other activates have spun off 
            from our meals together. For example, 
            Forces of Nature gardening project.

         <p class="homepage__endText">
            Come: relax, enjoy good food, good 
            company, vibes, good support and leave
            your rank behind when you sit down and 
            eat with us!

                About Us
            </h2>
            <p class="about__text">
                We are a growing mutual support 
                group of serving and veteran armed 
                forces people and the supporters 
                from the local community. We believe 
                that at one point in each of our lives
                we made a very unique decision to serve
                humanity in a very special way. This is 
                why members of the community get a lot 
                out of helping us to thrive.
                </br>
                Our philosophy is simple. We sit down 
                to eat together and share experience, 
                strength and hope with each other. We 
                share ideas and knowledge with each 
                other and help each other. No referral 
                neeeded - just show up and enjoy a 
                decent dinner and share some banter. 
                Or sit quietly if you wish.
                </br>
                You can relax with us - your status 
                outside the Club or military rank is 
                not an issue here. We are here for 
                each other. We sit together and 
                stand together.  
                </br>
                We are kindly hosted and sponsored 
                by the Church of England Parish of 
                St Dunstan and All Saints', Stepney.
                But are not 'churchy' our main focus 
                is our meals together.
                </br>
                We are connected into the London Armed 
                Forces Network and the Thrive Together 
                programme managed by the Poppy Factory. 
                We also havea whole list of connections 
                that we can introduce you to including 
                the Defence Medical Welfare Service, 
                Veterans' Business Base, Department

                community outreach programme.
                </br>
                Whilst we may have 'professionals' 
                involved with us as friends and guides, 
                and that includes the Rector and staff 
                of the Parish, everything we do - we 
                do it for each other.

                We believe this of ourselves: We,
                each one of us, have made a unique 
                decision at least once in our lives
                to serve humanity in a very special 
                way. Therefore, we fully understand
                each other's needs. We are therefore, 
                indebted to our Principle Sponsor and 
                to all our friends for strengthening 
                our ability to support each other in 
                profound, deeply meaningful and 
                practical ways.

                The Parish of St Dunstan and All 
                Saints', Stepney have opened their 
                hearts and their doors to us. They

                ingredients and then venue for free.

                We are not a 'churchy' group. You will 
                find a warm, discrete welcome from the 
                church and leadership. What you won't 
                find is 'Bible Bashing', proselytizing 
                and judgement.
                </br>
                However, if you wish to tap into the 
                church with a one to one chat with the 
                rector or chaplain - that's on offer. 
                If you wish to sit quietly in a corner 
                of the church to pray - that's on offer. 
                If you wish to talk about life events 
                like baptism, confirmation or marriage - 
                that's on offer. If you want to come to 
                Mass - that's on offer. f you want to talk 
                privately about spiritual matters - that's 
                on offer. If you want to be left alone just 
                to enjoy your lunch - that's on offer too!
